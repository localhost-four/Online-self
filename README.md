## Installation
### ¬∑ Replit
#### The code inside the repository was originally made to be hostable on [Replit](https://replit.com), but due to a recent ban on all repositories that are against Discord's ToS, you won't be able to import this repository directly to Replit anymore.
#### Here's a workaround to solve that issue:
1. download the latest version of this code.
2. Unzip the file
3. Create a new Python repl on [Replit](https://replit.com)
4. Upload the files into the repl (Just drag and drop it into the files sidebar)
5. Overwrite the files if a prompt pops-up
6. Add your token inside Secrets with `TOKEN` as the key and your token as the value
7. Modify both the status mode and custom status, if you want to make any adjustments
8. Run the repl

### ¬∑ Local Installation

</details>

### [Replit] sh: line 1: python3: command not found
<details>
<summary>Click here to view the explanation and fix</summary>
<br>
You cloned it into a bash repl. Make sure you select "Python" from the languages list when you create the repl.
</details>

### [Replit] Cloudflare Error/Temporarily banned from accessing Discord's API
<details>
<summary>Click here to view the explanation and fix</summary>
<br>
This happens because repls have Shared Public IP Addresses, and some Replit Users abuse the platform to spam (through self bots or nukers). Whenever Discord sees lots of invalid requests coming from a single IP address, it will use Cloudflare to temporarily block any incoming requests.

#### Fix:
- Go to shell
- Enter <code>kill 1</code>
- Wait for the repl to reload
- Run the repl again
